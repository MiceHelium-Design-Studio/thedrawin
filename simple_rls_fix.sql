DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own media files" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own media files" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all media files" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload their own profile images" ON storage.objects;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own profile images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own draw images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload their own draw images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own draw images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own draw images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage banner images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view banner images" ON storage.objects;
